## About this Repository

Kumu.io is one of the coolest platforms in existence. The documentation is really great, but fairly regularly I find myself using snippets of code that I have learned from someone on the slack Kumunity or work arounds I have come up with myself, that aren't found in docs.kumu.io. This is a place to keep them organized.

For the sake of being able to easily tag and sort them, the snippets are stored in the Discussions section in the [Code Snippets](https://github.com/morganwills/kumu/discussions/categories/code-snippets) thread. Keeping them all in this thread and always tagging a snippet allows for ease of searchability.

There are two other discussion threads: [Good to know](https://github.com/morganwills/kumu/discussions/categories/good-to-know) and [Examples and use cases](https://github.com/morganwills/kumu/discussions/categories/examples-and-use-cases), for storing useful information and examples that aren't necessarily a code snippet or problem solving specific scenarios.

The [wiki](https://github.com/morganwills/kumu/wiki) in this git repo will curate the most salient of these discussion threads.
