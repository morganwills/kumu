## About this Repository

Kumu.io is one of the coolest platforms in existence. The documentation is really great, but fairly regularly I find myself using snippets of code that I have learned from someone on the slack Kumunity or work arounds I have come up with myself, that aren't found in docs.kumu.io. This is a place to keep them organized.

For the sake of being able to tag and sort code them, the snippets are stored in the Issues section. Keeping them all as "open" issues and always tagging a snippet allows for ease of searchability.

The wiki in this git repo is for storing useful information for using Kumu that isn't necessarily a snippet of code for the advanced editor!
